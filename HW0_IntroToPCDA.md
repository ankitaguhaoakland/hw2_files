# Homework 0: Introduction to PCDA Class

Since our first main topic will be learning to use the Linux shell, and
since we are going to use *markdown* quite a bit, let's use a tool
known as `pandoc` to convert this markdown document to html.

## 1 The pcda appliance

I just want you to start to get comfortable with using the Lubuntu Linux based
pcda virtual machine. Below are some suggestions for things to do to start to
gain this familiarity. Please feel free to go beyond this and explore away.

- Start up VirtualBox and start the pcda-1604-f17 virtual machine.  
- Explore the LXPanel (i.e. the Start button) in the lower left corner. Check
  out the various program groups to see what applications have been installed on pcda. Feel free to try
  out some of the applications (e.g. the simple Leafpad text editor or the Xpad
  “sticky note” application).
- Launch the Firefox browser by clicking the Internet icon in the lower left of the task bar.
- Launch the File Manager by clicking the little folder icon in the task bar.
    * Browse through some of the folders to get a
      sense of the folder structure on the machine. As you do this, look in the
      address bar of the FileManager to start to see the details of the folder paths
      as we'll be working with paths quite a bit. IMPORTANT: Folders in Linux are
      separated by the forward slash and NOT by a backslash. The MS choice of
      Windows. You'll see why.
    * Explore the various navigation buttons in the File Manager for
      navigating between folders and creating new tabs.
    * Explore the menus in the File Manager to become more familiar with the
      functionality available in this simple application.
    * Within the Documents folder, create a new folder for this class
- Go to System Tools | Lubuntu Software Center to launch the Sofware
Center app. From here you can find and install all kinds of software. For now,
let's install the widely used Linux screen shot utility, Shutter.  
    * Search for "screenshot" in the Software Center search box. Select Shutter
      from the results.
    * Click on the Information button at bottom of screen. Click the Add to the Apps Basket button. 
      You'll see that the Apps Basket will show a (1) to indicate 1 item.
    * Go to the Apps Basket and click the Install Packages button. Linux is all
      about security and you'll be forced to enter the pcda password to install
      any software.
    * When it's done installing, close the Sofware Center application.
    * Go to the Start button and find Shutter and launch it. Figure out how
      to do a screenshot and save as a PNG file.
      

Feel free to explore pcda – try out some of the apps, install new apps. For example, you might
want to install Libre Office. **Just
DO NOT remove any software that I've already installed. I've already installed
all of the R and Python related stuff we'll need.** Notice that you can easily
switch back into Windows just by clicking the Windows task bar. At the very
bottom right of the pcda window, you'll find the Shutdown button. Click it and
shut down the virtual machine. Always use this method to shutdown. After pcda
shuts down, you'll find yourself back in Windows and you can then quit VirtualBox.
